def automatic_memory_response(memory_trace, instincts, emotions, body_energy, consciousness):
    """
    Calculates the automatic memory response based on the given factors.

    Args:
        memory_trace: The strength and encoding details of the memory itself.
        instincts: The influence of biological drives, physical sensations, and natural responses.
        emotions: The influence of emotional state and intensity on memory retrieval.
        body_energy: The overall physical and energetic well-being, including factors like chakra alignment and energy flow.
        consciousness: The potential influence of both conscious intention and subconscious processes.

    Returns:
        The automatic memory response (AMR) as a float.
