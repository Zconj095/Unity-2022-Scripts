'''The selected code is part of a Python script that performs polynomial feature transformation and updates a virtual reality (VR) environment based on the transformed data. The code imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.

The script starts by creating an example DataFrame using Pandas. It then creates a PolynomialFeatures object with degree 2 and fits the transformed data to the DataFrame.

The script then defines two functions, update_vr_environment and render_vr_scene, which are assumed to be part of the VR system. The functions update the VR object state based on new_state and render the updated VR scene, respectively.

The script then simulates VR object state updates by looping through the transformed data and calling the update_vr_environment and render_vr_scene functions for each state.

Finally, the script plots the transformed data using Matplotlib and displays the resulting 3D scatter plot.'''
